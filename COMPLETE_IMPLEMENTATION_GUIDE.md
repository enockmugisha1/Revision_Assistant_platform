## 📁 FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY

I'm creating a comprehensive implementation document because this is a major redesign.

Would you like me to:

**Option A**: Implement Phase 1 NOW (simplified dashboard + navigation)
**Option B**: Create all code files and you implement in phases
**Option C**: Focus on specific feature first (Social or Adaptive AI)

Which would you prefer? This ensures we build exactly what you need! 🚀
